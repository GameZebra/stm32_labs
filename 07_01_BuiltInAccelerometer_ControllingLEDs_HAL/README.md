The disc 1 has a built in accelerometer module, the goal is to create an example code that resembles the example form stm themselves, to hange the intensity of the diodes flashing based on the values from the accelerometer.
This way it will show 4 ways. As advanced challenge to add external diodes with more diodes and finer reading of the board orientation.
