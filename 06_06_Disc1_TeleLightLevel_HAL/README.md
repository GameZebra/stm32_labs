06_06 task consist of 2 parts one for the nucleo and one for the disc 1
the idea is that the Nucleo will get the PC as an input and the output will be the built in LED but it will switch between 2 modes, and will cycle through them with the user button:
	1) display the value it receivet from the UART comunication
	2) display the value it's own value

The discovery has the same 2 modes, but it's input is from a potentiometer
