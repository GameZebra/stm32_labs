To use the timer the first thing in the code is to enable it

secondly we have to set the comparator value manually with the registere CCR1
(I couldn't find LL function that is doing this)

because we have only one comparator i'm comparing with code when will the timer hit it's autoreload value so that i can reset the comparator flag
